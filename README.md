A clone of [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors)
for [Clack](https://github.com/fukamachi/clack).

By default, when Clack throws an exception when rendering a page, the server
waits for the response until it times out while the exception waits in the
REPL. This isn't very useful. So now there's this.

# Usage

This,

```lisp
(clack:clackup
  (funcall clack-errors:*clack-error-middleware*
           *my-clack-app*
           :debug t)
  :port 8000)))
```

will wrap your Clack up in the clack-errors middleware, start the server and
return a handler object.

By default, the middleware will show all information. In a production
environment, you'll want to initialize this with the `:debug` parameter set to
NIL.

## Using a Custom Error Page

The middleware can be initialized with the `:fn` slot set to a lambda that takes
a condition as its argument and returns the HTML string to return to the client.

```lisp
(clack:clackup
  (funcall clack-errors:*clack-error-middleware*
    *app*
    :fn (lambda (condition) "500 Internal Server Error")))
```
